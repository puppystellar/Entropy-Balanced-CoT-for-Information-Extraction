## Entropy-Balanced-CoT-for-Information-Extraction
### Key Features

* **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Uses a **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** approach to break down complex information extraction tasks, leading to more accurate and explainable results.
* **Entropy-Constrained Optimization:** Employs an **entropy constraint** to dynamically balance the reasoning process. This ensures the model effectively explores high-entropy "exploration" phases and efficiently fills in details during low-entropy "information-filling" phases.
* **General Information Mining:** Designed to be a flexible and universal tool for extracting structured data from a wide variety of unstructured text.

### How It Works

Our approach is based on two core ideas:

1.  **CoT-driven Extraction:** The model is trained to generate a detailed reasoning process before producing the final output. This mimics human-like problem-solving, improving the quality and reliability of the extracted information.

2.  **Adaptive Phase Control:** We introduce an entropy-based constraint into the optimization process. This mechanism controls the model's behavior, encouraging it to be more exploratory when uncertainty (entropy) is high, and more focused on generating a complete and final answer when uncertainty is low.
